#Ruby Notes

IRB (Interative Ruby Shell): allows you to run Ruby commands in the command line

+ `irb` : start an IRB session
+ `exit` or `quit`: close an IRB session
+ `control + L`: clear the command line screen

Tips: run `.method` on any ruby object in IRB to obtain a full list of valid methods. You can also chain this with sort, `.method.sort`, to get a sorted list of methods.
